# Higher or Lower Game

Welcome to the Higher or Lower game! This fun game challenges you to guess which of two accounts has more followers. Test your knowledge and see how many correct guesses you can make in a row!

## Game Overview

In this game, you are presented with two accounts, each with their own follower count. Your goal is to guess which account has more followers. If your guess is correct, you earn a point and continue to the next round. If you guess incorrectly, the game ends and your final score is displayed.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Execute the script to start the game.
2. **Make a Guess**: You will be shown two accounts. Type 'A' if you think Account A has more followers or 'B' if you think Account B has more followers.
3. **Check Your Score**: After each guess, the game will inform you if you were correct or wrong and display your current score.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when you make an incorrect guess, and your final score will be displayed.
